        <h2>Michelle Gonzalez</h2>
        <p>I’m a recent graduated (July 2021) in Computer Science (CS) from CUNY College of Staten Island with experience working accross front-end of software development. Looking for a role where I can grow and learn from experienced team members while drawing on projects experience I have already succesfully executed.
            In today’s world, companies know that strong, personalized customer service is key for business growth. In my four years of experience in customer service and It support Assist, I’ve always strived to deliver proactive, individualized, and timely support, making the customer and team consistently feel cared for. I understand that propelling a company’s mission through every customer interaction is key to fostering long-term loyalty. 
            I am a native Latina speaker with a proficiency in English and Spanish and a strong determination to meet and exceed all your goals and expectations.
